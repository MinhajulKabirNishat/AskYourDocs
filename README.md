# Mini RAG System

A simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using FAISS.

## How to Run
1. Create venv
2. Install requirements
3. Run `python rag.py`
###
The rag_env folder (which had the oversized 250 MB file) should not be there.
#### .gitignore
By using the .gitignore file and doing a clean push, I have followed "best practices". <br>
I'm only sharing my code. Which is lightweight and fast, rather than sharing the massive virtual <br>
environment that only works on specific machines.
